# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Language

All UI text (labels, error messages, placeholders, buttons, tooltips) must be in **English**. No Spanish strings in the frontend.

## Repository layout

This monorepo contains two independent projects, each with its own git repository:

| Folder | Stack | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `logitrack_core/` | Go + Gin | REST API backend |
| `logitrack_web/` | React + Vite + TypeScript | Frontend SPA |

## Backend (`logitrack_core/`)

### Commands

```bash
# Run development server (port 8080)
go run cmd/server/main.go

# Build
go build ./...

# Tidy dependencies
go mod tidy

# Train ML model (generates model.json)
go run cmd/train/main.go

# Regenerate Swagger spec (run from logitrack_core/)
swag init -g cmd/server/main.go -o ../docs
rm ../docs/docs.go ../docs/swagger.json
# Output: docs/swagger.yaml at the repo root. Only the YAML is kept.
```

No test suite yet. `go build ./...` is the primary validation step.

### Architecture

Standard layered architecture — requests flow: `handler → service → repository`.

```

  repository/               # Interfaces + implementations; PostgreSQL-backed for Branch, Vehicle, MLConfig
                            #   shipment.go           — ShipmentRepository interface + command structs + in-memory adapter

```

**ML priority prediction** is integrated directly into the backend (no separate service). Uses `github.com/malaschitz/randomForest` for the RandomForest classifier. The ML pipeline (config → dataset → train → predict) lives in `internal/ml/`.

**Model storage**: the trained model is stored as a BYTEA blob in the `ml_models` PostgreSQL table, linked to the active `ml_configs` row. On startup, `MLConfigService.InitFromDB()` loads the active config's factors/thresholds and hot-loads the model blob from DB. Fallback chain: DB model → file (`ML_MODEL_PATH` env var, default `model.json`) → auto-train with defaults (if neither exists). `cmd/train/main.go` still exists as a CLI tool to generate a file-based model for the initial Docker build.

**Factor weights and thresholds are configurable at runtime** by admins via `POST /api/v1/ml/config/regenerate`. On regeneration: the new config is saved to `ml_configs`, the forest is retrained with the new weights, the blob is saved to `ml_models`, the in-memory model is hot-swapped, and priorities are recalculated for all non-terminal shipments. Previous configurations are retained as history and can be re-activated via `POST /api/v1/ml/config/:id/activate`.

**Priority is computed and persisted** in three moments:
- `Create` — predicted from `CreateShipmentRequest` before the repo call; stored on the shipment.
- `ConfirmDraft` — predicted from the draft shipment before `ConfirmDraftCmd`; passed in the cmd so the projection persists it in the `EventDraftConfirmed` handler.
- `CorrectShipment` — re-predicted when any ML-relevant field is corrected (`shipment_type`, `time_window`, `cold_chain`, `is_fragile`, `origin_province`, `destination_province`). The effective values are computed as: original shipment → apply all previously stored corrections → apply incoming correction. This ensures successive edits are consistent.

**Priority fields** stored on `Shipment` and persisted to DB:
- `priority` — `"alta"` / `"media"` / `"baja"` (thresholds are configurable; defaults: alta > 0.65, media > 0.35)
- `priority_score` — 0.0–1.0 weighted score
- `priority_confidence` — 0.0–1.0 forest vote share for the winning class
- `priority_factors` — `map[string]FactorDetail` per-factor breakdown (JSONB in DB)

**Priority factor weights** — configurable by admin (range 1.0–5.0); defaults:

| Factor | Default weight | Normalization |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| `shipment_type` | 3.0 | express=1.0 / normal=0.0 |
| `distance_km` | 2.5 | Haversine(origin, dest) / 2500 |
| `restrictions` | 2.0 | (is_fragile + cold_chain) / 2 |
| `time_window` | 1.5 | morning=1.0 / afternoon=0.5 / flexible=0.0 |
| `volume_score` | 1.0 | (pkg_base + weight_kg/2) / 25 |
| `route_saturation` | 0.8 | deterministic FNV hash of "origin-dest" route |

Province coordinates for distance (all 24 Argentine provinces + CABA) are defined in `internal/ml/dataset.go ProvinceCoords`. Unknown provinces fall back to Ciudad de Buenos Aires.

**The Dockerfile trains the model** at build time (`RUN go run cmd/train/main.go model.json`) to produce an initial `model.json`. At runtime, if the DB already has an active config with a model blob, that takes precedence and the file is ignored. `model.json` is in `.gitignore`.

**Event sourcing — shipments.** `DomainEvent` objects are the source of truth. Shipment state is never mutated directly; instead each write operation appends a domain event to the `EventStore` and applies it to the `ShipmentProjection` (materialized view). Reads (List, Search, Stats, GetByTrackingID) are served from the projection. `GetEvents` transforms `DomainEvent`s back to the `ShipmentEvent` API format.

**State is persisted in PostgreSQL (RDS).** `EventStore` and `ShipmentProjection` are backed by the database — the service and handler layers are unchanged from the in-memory design.

**ShipmentRepository interface** uses command structs (not raw field parameters). Each command carries everything needed to build the domain event internally: `CreateShipmentCmd`, `SaveDraftCmd`, `UpdateDraftCmd`, `ConfirmDraftCmd`, `StatusUpdateCmd`, `CorrectCmd`, `CancelCmd`. The methods `UpdateLocation`, `SetDeliveredAt`, and `AddEvent` no longer exist — their effects are absorbed into the relevant commands.

**Auth** uses UUID tokens stored in memory. `POST /api/v1/auth/login` returns a token; all other routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Tokens are lost on restart.

**Hardcoded users** (in `repository/auth.go`):
- `operator / operator123` → RoleOperator
- `supervisor / supervisor123` → RoleSupervisor
- `gerente / gerente123` → RoleManager
- `admin / admin123` → RoleAdmin
- `chofer / chofer123` → RoleDriver

**Tracking ID formats**:
- Confirmed shipments: `LT-XXXXXXXX` (generated on create or on draft confirmation)
- Drafts: `DRAFT-XXXXXXXX` (replaced by a real `LT-` ID when confirmed)

**Shipment state machine** (enforced in `service/shipment.go`):
```
pending (draft) ──confirm──► in_progress ──[vehicle assigned]──► pre_transit ──[StartTrip]──► in_transit ──► at_branch ──► in_transit (next hop)
                                         └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────├─► delivering ──► delivered
                                                                                                                         │              └─► delivery_failed ──► delivering (retry)
                                                                                                                         │                                  └─► at_branch (return leg)
                                                                                                                         ├─► ready_for_pickup ──► delivered

```
- `pending` = draft; transitions only via `ConfirmDraft`, not `UpdateStatus`.
- `in_progress` = confirmed, awaiting vehicle assignment.
- `pre_transit` = vehicle assigned and being loaded; shipment not yet departed. Reverts to `in_progress` if unassigned from vehicle; can also go directly to `at_branch` (edge case).
- `in_transit` only goes to `at_branch` — never directly to `delivered`.
- `delivering` = out for last-mile delivery to recipient.
- `delivering` only goes to `delivered` or `delivery_failed` — never back to `at_branch` directly.
- `delivery_failed` = attempted but unsuccessful; supervisor/admin decide next step.
- `ready_for_pickup` = recipient will pick up at the current branch (any branch).
- `ready_for_return` = sender will pick up at the **origin branch** only (enforced server-side: `current_location` must equal the receiving branch's city).
- `delivered`, `returned`, `cancelled` are terminal states — no further transitions.
- Multi-hop routes repeat `at_branch → pre_transit → in_transit → at_branch` (via vehicle assignment and StartTrip).
- Cancellable states: `in_progress`, `at_branch`, `delivering`, `delivery_failed`, `ready_for_pickup`, `ready_for_return`. States `pre_transit` and `in_transit` cannot be cancelled (vehicle is actively loaded/in movement). `pending` and terminal states cannot be cancelled either.

**DNI validation** (enforced before any repo write in `service/shipment.go`):
- `→ delivered`: `recipient_dni` required and must match `shipment.recipient_dni`.
- `→ returned`: `sender_dni` required and must match `shipment.sender_dni`.
- Validation happens **before** `repo.UpdateStatus()` to prevent state corruption on a failed attempt.

**Field format validation** (enforced in `service/shipment.go` for `Create`, `SaveDraft`, `UpdateDraft`, `ConfirmDraft`):
- `sender_dni` / `recipient_dni`: must contain only digits. In drafts, validated only when the field is non-empty; required and validated on `Create` and `ConfirmDraft`.
- `sender_email` / `recipient_email`: must match `user@domain.tld` format. Validated only when non-empty (emails are optional).

**`location` field on status updates** — rules vary by transition:
- `in_progress → pre_transit`: set automatically by vehicle assignment (no manual status update needed)
- `pre_transit → in_transit`: set automatically by `StartTrip` (destination branch city); do not send manually
- `in_transit → at_branch`: auto-derived from last `in_transit` event; do not send
- `at_branch → pre_transit`: set automatically by vehicle assignment; do not send manually
- `at_branch → delivering`: not required (going to recipient, not a branch)
- `at_branch → ready_for_pickup`: not required
- `at_branch → ready_for_return`: not required
- `ready_for_pickup → pre_transit`: set automatically by vehicle assignment
- `delivering → delivered`: not required
- `delivering → delivery_failed`: not required
- `delivery_failed → at_branch`: not required — auto-derived from the last `at_branch` event

**Role-based route permissions** (defined in `main.go`):
- Non-driver roles (operator, supervisor, manager, admin): GET /shipments, /branches, /branches/search, /search, /customers, /vehicles
- All roles including driver: GET /shipments/:id, /shipments/:id/events, /shipments/:id/comments, /vehicles/by-shipment/:trackingId
- Operator + Supervisor + Admin: POST /shipments, /shipments/draft; PATCH /shipments/:id/draft; POST /shipments/:id/confirm
- Operator + Supervisor + Admin + Driver: PATCH /shipments/:id/status (operator and driver further restricted in handler — see below)
- Operator + Supervisor + Admin: POST /shipments/:id/comments
- Supervisor + Manager + Admin: GET /stats, /vehicles/by-plate/:plate
- Operator + Supervisor + Manager + Admin: GET /vehicles/available
- Supervisor + Admin: GET /users/drivers; PATCH /vehicles/by-plate/:plate/status; POST /vehicles/by-plate/:plate/assign-branch, /start-trip, /end-trip; DELETE /vehicles/by-plate/:plate/shipments/:trackingId; PATCH /branches/:id/status
- Operator + Supervisor + Admin: POST /vehicles/by-plate/:plate/assign (assigns shipment to vehicle → pre_transit)
- Admin only: POST /vehicles (create vehicle); POST /branches, PATCH /branches/:id
- Admin only: GET /ml/config, GET /ml/config/history, POST /ml/config/regenerate, POST /ml/config/:id/activate
- Driver only: GET /driver/route

**Operator restrictions** (enforced in `handler/shipment.go UpdateStatus`):
- Operators cannot update a shipment that is in `delivering` status — all transitions from `delivering` are reserved for supervisor, admin, and driver. Transitions to `delivered` from other states (e.g. `ready_for_pickup → delivered`) are allowed.

**Driver restrictions** (enforced in `RouteService.ValidateDriverCanUpdateShipment`):
- Drivers can only update shipments assigned to their today's route.
- Drivers can only set status to `delivered` or `delivery_failed`.

**Route system** (service/route.go):
- Routes link a driver to a list of shipments for a specific date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Route ID format: `ROUTE-XXXXXXXX`.
- When a supervisor sets a shipment to `delivering` with a `driver_id`, the shipment is auto-added to that driver's route for today via `AddShipmentToDriverRoute`.
- `GET /driver/route` returns today's route + full shipment details for the authenticated driver.

**Comments** (service/comment.go):
- Supervisor and admin can add comments to any non-finalized shipment.
- Comments cannot be added to `delivered` or `returned` shipments.
- All authenticated users can read comments.

**Corrections** (service/shipment.go `CorrectShipment`, repo `ApplyCorrections`):
- Non-destructive edits for confirmed shipments — original data is never modified.
- Stored in `Shipment.Corrections ShipmentCorrections` (typed struct with `*field` pointers); corrections accumulate on successive calls via `Merge()`.
- Endpoint: `PATCH /shipments/:tracking_id/correct` — supervisor and admin only.
- Blocked on `pending` (edit the draft directly) and terminal states (`delivered`, `returned`, `cancelled`).
- Each corrected field auto-generates a comment: `[Correction] <label>. New value: <value>`.
- Creates a `ShipmentEvent` with `event_type: "edited"` (status unchanged).
- `ShipmentHandler` holds a reference to `CommentService` to persist auto-comments after corrections.
- Correctable fields include all sender/recipient/address fields plus: `weight_kg`, `package_type`, `special_instructions`, `shipment_type`, `time_window`, `cold_chain`, `is_fragile`.
- When any ML-relevant field is corrected, priority is automatically recomputed and persisted (passed in `CorrectCmd.Prediction`, handled in the `EventShipmentCorrected` projection handler).

**Cancellation** (service/shipment.go `CancelShipment`):
- Endpoint: `POST /shipments/:tracking_id/cancel` — supervisor and admin only.
- Body: `{ "reason": "..." }` — reason is required; returns 400 if empty.
- Blocked on `pending` and all terminal states (`delivered`, `returned`, `cancelled`).
- On success: transitions to `cancelled`, creates a `ShipmentEvent` (from_status → cancelled), and auto-adds a comment `[Cancelación] <reason>`.

**Customer autocomplete** (handler/customer.go, repository/customer.go):
- `GET /customers?dni=XXXXX` returns a stored customer by exact DNI match.
- Customers are auto-upserted whenever a shipment is created (both sender and recipient).
- In `NewShipment`, typing ≥7 digits triggers a lookup after 400ms debounce. If a match is found, a suggestion popover appears below the DNI field with the customer's name, phone and city — the user must click "Use data" to apply it. Nothing is auto-filled without confirmation.

**Fleet management** (handler/vehicle.go, repository/vehicle.go, model/vehicle.go):
- Vehicles are fleet assets tracked independently of shipments and drivers.
- Each vehicle has: `license_plate` (unique), `type` (motocicleta/furgoneta/camion/camion_grande), `capacity_kg`, `status`, `assigned_branch` (current branch ID), `destination_branch` (set during a trip), `assigned_shipments` (list of tracking IDs currently loaded).
- **Vehicle statuses**: `disponible` → `en_carga` (shipments being loaded) → `en_transito` (trip in progress) → back to `disponible` on `EndTrip`. Also: `mantenimiento` and `inactivo` (manual transitions, require `force: true` if shipments are assigned).
- **Vehicle → Shipment lifecycle**:
  1. `POST /vehicles/by-plate/:plate/assign` — assigns a shipment to the vehicle; shipment transitions to `pre_transit`; vehicle moves from `disponible` to `en_carga`.
  2. `DELETE /vehicles/by-plate/:plate/shipments/:trackingId` — removes a shipment while `en_carga`; shipment reverts to `at_branch`; vehicle returns to `disponible` if no shipments remain.
  3. `POST /vehicles/by-plate/:plate/start-trip` — body: `{ "destination_branch": "<id>" }`; all assigned shipments transition to `in_transit`; vehicle moves to `en_transito`.
  4. `POST /vehicles/by-plate/:plate/end-trip` — all assigned shipments transition to `at_branch` at destination city; vehicle moves to `disponible` at the destination branch; shipments list is cleared.
- **Assignment rules**: vehicle must be `disponible` or `en_carga`; vehicle must have an `assigned_branch`; shipment must be `in_progress`, `at_branch`, or `ready_for_pickup`; shipment's branch must match vehicle's `assigned_branch`; total weight of assigned shipments must not exceed `capacity_kg`.
- **`GET /vehicles/available`** — optional query params: `type`, `min_capacity`, `branch_id`. Returns vehicles with status `disponible` or `en_carga`.
- **`GET /vehicles/by-shipment/:trackingId`** — returns the vehicle (if any) currently assigned to that shipment. Available to all roles.

### Adding a new endpoint

1. Add struct to `internal/model/` if needed
2. Add method to the repository interface and `inMemory` implementation
3. Add method to the service
4. Add handler method and register route in `handler/`
5. Apply role middleware in `main.go`

## Frontend (`logitrack_web/`)

### Commands

```bash
# Dev server (port 5173)
npm run dev

# Type-check + production build
npm run build

# Lint
npm run lint
```

`npm run build` runs `tsc -b` before Vite — use it to validate TypeScript.

### Architecture

```
src/
  api/          # Axios clients: shipments.ts, auth.ts, branches.ts, driver.ts, users.ts, customers.ts, vehicles.ts, mlConfig.ts
                # shipments.ts has request interceptor (adds Bearer token) and
                # response interceptor (redirects to /login on 401)
  context/      # AuthContext: stores user + token in localStorage, exposes login/logout/hasRole
  components/   # ProtectedRoute (role guard), StatusBadge, PriorityBadge
  pages/        # One file per screen (including BranchList, DriverRoute, DriverShipmentDetail, VehicleList, VehicleStatus, VehicleAssignment, AvailableVehicles, MLConfig)
  utils/date.ts # fmtDate / fmtDateTime — always use these for date display (DD/MM/AAAA format)
```

**Auth flow**: `AuthContext` reads from `localStorage` on mount. `ProtectedRoute` redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` and unauthorized roles to `/`. The 401 interceptor in `api/shipments.ts` clears localStorage and redirects when the backend token expires (e.g. after a server restart).

**Role-gated UI** uses `hasRole(...roles)` from `useAuth()`. Key gates:
- `+ New Shipment` button: hidden from managers
- Status update panel in `ShipmentDetail`: operator + supervisor + admin
- Dashboard nav link: only supervisor + manager + admin
- `✏️ Edit data` button in `ShipmentDetail`: operator + supervisor + admin, hidden on `pending`/`delivered`/`returned`/`cancelled`
- `Cancel shipment` button in `ShipmentDetail`: only supervisor + admin, hidden on `pending` and terminal states (`delivered`, `returned`, `cancelled`)
- Fleet nav link (`Fleet`): all non-driver roles
- Vehicle assignment panel in `ShipmentDetail`: operator + supervisor + admin, shown when shipment is `in_progress`, `at_branch`, or `ready_for_pickup`
- ML Config nav link: admin only
- `Export CSV` button in `ShipmentList`: only admin + manager; exports the currently filtered shipments (state, branch, date range, search text all applied)

**Branches** are fetched from `GET /api/v1/branches` at runtime — never hardcoded in the frontend. The `branchLabel(city, branches)` helper in `api/branches.ts` maps a city string to a display name. In `RouteTimeline`, nodes show city + province directly from the branches array (not the display name). Use `branchApi.listActive()` for dropdowns that should only offer operational branches (e.g. receiving branch on new shipment). The `Branch` interface exposes `address` (street, city, province, postal_code), `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`. Helpers `statusLabel()` and `statusColor()` are in `api/branches.ts`.

**Branch dropdowns** (receiving branch in NewShipment, destination branch in VehicleList start-trip) group options by province with `<optgroup>` and sort both provinces and branches within each group alphabetically via `localeCompare`.

**ShipmentList filter**: the `status` query param pre-selects the filter on load (e.g. `/?status=pending`). Default filter is `active` (excludes `delivered`, `pending`, `returned`, and `cancelled`). A **branch filter** by `receiving_branch_id` and a **date range filter** are also applied client-side. Date filtering uses local timezone to avoid UTC/local mismatches; the backend `date_from`/`date_to` params are not used. The branch filter dropdown uses the same province-grouped, alphabetically sorted select pattern.

**Draft workflow**: drafts (`pending`) are created via `POST /shipments/draft` and edited via `PATCH /shipments/:id/draft`. After saving changes in `ShipmentDetail`, the UI redirects to `/?status=pending` (shipment list pre-filtered to Draft). Confirming a draft via `POST /shipments/:id/confirm` generates a real `LT-` tracking ID and moves the shipment to `in_progress`.

**ShipmentList filter**: the `status` query param pre-selects the filter on load (e.g. `/?status=pending`). Default filter is `active` (excludes `delivered`, `pending`, `returned`, and `cancelled`). Date filtering is applied client-side using local timezone — the backend `date_from`/`date_to` params are not used, to avoid UTC/local timezone mismatches in displayed dates.

**Shipment list ordering**: the backend returns shipments sorted by tracking ID ascending (`List()` and `Search()` both apply `sort.Slice`).

**CSV export**: admin and manager can download the currently filtered shipment list as a CSV file via the "Export CSV" button. The export is client-side (no extra API call) and reflects all active filters. Corrected field values take precedence over originals. File name format: `shipments_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`. Sender/recipient names are intentionally excluded (personal data — Ley 25.326); no DNI, email, phone, or full address is exported. See spec US-074.

## Git workflow

Branches: `main` (production, auto-deploys to Amplify) and `develop` (integration base). All feature work branches from `develop`.

```

## Specs

`docs/specs/` contains functional specifications organized by domain (auth, roles, shipments, state machine, branches, dashboard, public tracking). Written in Given/When/Then format. New features should have a spec written first — see `docs/specs/00-indice.md`.

## Running locally (both services)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
cd logitrack_core && go run cmd/server/main.go

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd logitrack_web && npm run dev
```

Frontend at http://localhost:5173, API at http://localhost:8080.

`VITE_API_URL` env var overrides the default API base URL (`http://localhost:8080/api/v1`).

## Domain model

Seven core entities plus supporting value objects:

| Entity | Key fields | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Shipment** | tracking_id, status, sender/recipient info, origin/destination (Address), weight_kg, package_type, shipment_type, time_window, cold_chain, is_fragile, receiving_branch_id, current_location, timestamps, priority, priority_score, priority_confidence, priority_factors, corrections | Central aggregate. Tracking ID is `LT-XXXX` (confirmed) or `DRAFT-XXXX` (pending). `corrections` is a typed `ShipmentCorrections` struct of non-destructive field overrides. Priority fields are set by the ML service on create/confirm/correct. |
| **ShipmentEvent** | id, tracking_id, event_type, from_status, to_status, changed_by, location, notes, timestamp | Immutable audit log of every status change. `event_type`: `"status_change"` or `"edited"`. |
| **ShipmentComment** | id, tracking_id, author, body, created_at | Internal notes on a shipment. Cannot be added to finalized shipments. |
| **Branch** | id, name, address (street, city, province, postal_code), province, status, created_at, updated_at, updated_by | Logistics warehouses/branches. Persistent in PostgreSQL. Statuses: activo, inactivo, fuera_de_servicio. CRUD via service/branch.go. |
| **User** | id, username, role | Auth identity. Roles: `operator`, `supervisor`, `manager`, `admin`, `driver`. |
| **Route** | id, date, driver_id, shipment_ids[], created_by, created_at | Links a driver to shipments for a given day. ID format: `ROUTE-XXXXXXXX`. |
| **Customer** | dni, name, phone, email, address | Auto-populated from shipment sender/recipient data. Used for DNI autocomplete. |
| **Vehicle** | id, license_plate, type, capacity_kg, status, updated_at, updated_by, assigned_shipments[], assigned_branch, destination_branch | Fleet vehicle. `license_plate` is unique. `assigned_branch` = current branch; `destination_branch` set during a trip. Persisted in PostgreSQL via `postgres_vehicle.go`. |
| **MLConfig** | id, factors (map), alta_threshold, media_threshold, is_active, created_by, created_at, notes | One active config at a time. Factor weights range 1.0–5.0. History retained indefinitely. Model blob stored separately in `ml_models` table (BYTEA). |

**Value objects**: `Address` (street, city, province, postal_code), `Status` (enum), `PackageType` (enum: envelope, box, pallet), `ShipmentType` (enum: normal, express), `TimeWindow` (enum: morning, afternoon, flexible), `Role` (enum), `VehicleStatus` (enum: disponible, en_carga, mantenimiento, en_transito, inactivo), `VehicleType` (enum: motocicleta, furgoneta, camion, camion_grande).

**Key relationships**:
- Shipment 1→N ShipmentEvent (status history)
- Shipment 1→N ShipmentComment (internal notes)
- Shipment N→1 Branch (via receiving_branch_id)
- Route N→N Shipment (via shipment_ids)
- Route N→1 User/Driver (via driver_id)
- Vehicle N→N Shipment (via assigned_shipments — tracking IDs currently loaded on the vehicle)
- Vehicle N→1 Branch (via assigned_branch)

## Seed data

On startup, `seed.Load()` populates 36 branches, 8 sample shipments, and 3 sample vehicles:

**Branches** (seed/branch_seed.go `LoadBranches`): 36 branches across all Argentine provinces, persisted in PostgreSQL. Each has a full address (street, city, province, postal_code) and status `activo`. Seeded via `Create` with duplicate-name protection — idempotent on restart.

Branch `name` follows the format `XXXX-NN` — 4-letter code derived from the city name + 2-digit counter per city (e.g. `CDBA-01` for Ciudad de Buenos Aires, `CORD-01` for Córdoba). Increment the counter (`-02`, `-03`) if a second branch exists in the same city.

**Sample shipments** cover key scenarios:
- `LT-A1B2C3D4`: at_branch (Córdoba) — standard single-hop
- `LT-E5F6G7H8`: delivered (Mendoza) — completed delivery
- `LT-I9J0K1L2`: in_progress (CABA) — just created, awaiting first dispatch
- `LT-M3N4O5P6`: in_transit (Jujuy→Posadas) — mid-route
- `LT-Q7R8S9T0`: delivered (CABA) — completed, originated from Córdoba
- `LT-U1V2W3X4`: in_progress (CABA) — recently created, long-distance to Río Gallegos
- `LT-DELIVER01`, `LT-DELIVER02`: at_branch (CABA) — ready for last-mile delivery assignment
- `LT-MULTI001`: at_branch (Jujuy) — multi-hop: CABA→Córdoba→Mendoza→Jujuy with full event history

Customers from all shipments are auto-upserted into the customer repository for DNI autocomplete.

**Sample vehicles** (seed/seed.go `LoadVehicles`):
- `AB123CD`: furgoneta, 800 kg, disponible — assigned to caba
- `EF456GH`: camion, 5000 kg, disponible — assigned to cordoba
- `IJ789KL`: motocicleta, 50 kg, mantenimiento — assigned to caba
